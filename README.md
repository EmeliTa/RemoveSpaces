# Remove Spaces from String - Java Project

This is a Java program that removes all white spaces from a given string without using the `replace()` method. It demonstrates a simple approach to achieve this task.

## How It Works

The program defines a method called `removeWhiteSpaces` that takes an input string and returns the same string with all white spaces removed. It iterates through each character in the input string and appends non-whitespace characters to a `StringBuilder`. The final result is obtained by converting the `StringBuilder` to a string.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java code using the Java compiler (typically `javac`):

   ```bash
   javac RemoveSpaces.java
